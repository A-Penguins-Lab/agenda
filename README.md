# agenda
The agenda of this account is very simple. It's just there to celebrate the fact that open source exists and we're allowed to recreate results from papers or repos or articles. I am an undegrad who just finished college and after 4h years of fooling around I finally came to appreciate the efforts that engineers and researchers put into their craft. Hence I want to play my role as an open source lover and rebuild existing stuff. 

Often times we overlook the value of this craft, as I believe it can create immense value when done right. My inspo really comes from The Primeagen where he emphasizes the importance of reinventing the wheel to learn something. Of course, I don't do this when I'm working at a company (unless instructed to). 

Here are the rules: 
1. I read a paper or a blog, I get interested and I build it
2. Each repo will start with r, standing for reproduced from a source.
3. All original works and papers will be appropriately cited and given credits to.
4. Finally, all my efforts will be put onto the internet via arxiv or my blog.
5. Each repo will recreate parts if not all of the project.
6. All repos will be MIT licensed and free of use.

That's it. Welcome to my lab!
